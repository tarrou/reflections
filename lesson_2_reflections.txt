What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new directory, ".git", is established that is used to keep track of the 
file history. You need to do it so that git can take a snapshot of the files 
you'll be using in your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a subset of the working directory that only includes the 
files relavant to a particular commit. The repository is the result of 
committing the staging area. This is useful because it allows you to 'bundle' 
the relevant files for a particular logical change.
