When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

Well, it's a backup. So that's cool. More importantly, though, it can be used 
on lots of computers, so collaboration and moving around is easy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You don't want code someone else is writing to interfere with yours.
